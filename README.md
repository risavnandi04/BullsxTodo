# Django BullsxTodo Project

This is a backend-focused Django project that implements a Todo application. The application is also hosted on PythonAnywhere and can be accessed at risav.pythonanywhere.com

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (The project has been tested with Python 3.12 and the hosting server runs it on 3.10)
- Django 5.0
- Django Rest Framework 3.14

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**: Download all the files from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/risavnandi04/BullsxTodo.git
    ```

2. **Set up a Python environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment using `conda` or a similar tool. This isolates the project and its dependencies from other Python projects on your system.

    ```bash
    conda create --name <name> python #replace <name> with desired env name
    conda activate <name>
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory (the one containing `requirements.txt`) and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Start the server**: Run the following command to start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

5. **Access the application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:8000` to access the application.
